# game
Ah! The most important package! Please wash your hands before touching anything
in here. Seriously, don't spread germs. And do not break anything. This
directory contains all so-called JabaScwipt files for the game. All JS files in
here will be compiled by Webpack into a single bundle file (which will be
written to /assets/dist).

Do NOT write LONG JS files. Remember abstraction and decomposition, please!
